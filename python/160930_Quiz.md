We call a fraction a / b a nice fraction, if a and b are 5-digit positive integers and all ten digits are used exactly once in a and b combined (leading zeros are possible).

For a given integer n find the number in nice fractions, that are equal to n.

Example

For n = 22, the output should be
niceFractions(n) = 1.

The only nice fraction is 51678 / 02349.

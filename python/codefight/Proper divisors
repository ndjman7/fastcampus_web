Define d(k) as the sum of proper divisors of k.

A positive integer a is called an amicable number if there exists another positive integer b (b ≠ a) such that d(a) = b and d(b) = a (numbers a and b form an amicable pair).

Find the smallest amicable number not less than the given integer.

Example

For n = 1, the output should be
amicableNumbers(n) = 220;
For n = 200, the output should be
amicableNumbers(n) = 220;
For n = 221, the output should be
amicableNumbers(n) = 284.
The two smallest amicable numbers are 220 and 284.
